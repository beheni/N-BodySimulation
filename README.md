# N-BodySimulation
Branches:
- ```main```: temporary is not working, but we will fix it as soon as possible :+)
- ```computeShader```: trying to write compute shader. On this branch it doesn't work, but implementation of the compute shader was used on the branch "flying-particles"
- ```flying-particles```: currently our working version is here (brute-force algorithm)
